//! The composed multi-tenant cloud application.
//!
//! [`configure_cloud_app`] assembles atomic-server's granular route pieces
//! under cloud middleware, producing the service tree the `atomic-cloud serve`
//! binary listens on. The composition is deliberately narrower than the
//! self-hosted server's [`configure_app`](atomic_server::app::configure_app):
//!
//! - `GET /health` — public, no auth on any host: liveness, always up.
//! - `GET /ready` — public, no auth on any host: deploy-gated readiness
//!   ([`crate::deploy::Readiness`]). 503 `{"status":"migrating", ...}`
//!   while the boot fleet migration runs, 503 with the holding status when
//!   the failure-rate policy held the pod back, 200 once it admits (or an
//!   operator runs `deploy advance`). Liveness and readiness are split
//!   exactly so orchestrators keep migrating pods alive but unrouted.
//! - **The account plane** ([`crate::account_plane`]) — `POST
//!   /signup/request-link`, `POST /login/request-link`, `GET
//!   /signup/complete`, and `GET /login/complete`, served only on the
//!   **app host** (the bare base domain or `app.<base>`). No CloudAuth,
//!   no tenant state: these routes exist for people without accounts (or
//!   without a live session). The
//!   host split fails closed in both directions — the routes carry an
//!   app-host guard (404 on tenant subdomains), and tenant routes 404 on
//!   the app host because `CloudAuth` extracts no subdomain from the bare
//!   base and `app` is blocklisted from ever resolving to an account. See
//!   the account_plane module docs; the e2e suite pins both directions.
//! - **The tenant plane's cloud-owned routes** ([`crate::tenant_plane`]) —
//!   currently `DELETE /api/account`, the authenticated account-deletion
//!   route. Registered *before* atomic-server's `api_scope()` so the
//!   exact-path resource wins the route match; behind [`CloudAuth`] like
//!   everything else on a tenant subdomain.
//! - `GET /ws` — a **cloud-owned** WebSocket route under [`CloudAuth`].
//!   Self-hosted's public `/ws` route authenticates a `?token=` query
//!   parameter against the tenant's own `api_tokens` table — exactly the
//!   identity plane cloud replaces — so cloud routes its own handler straight
//!   to [`ws::start_event_session`], streaming the per-account event channel
//!   the middleware injected.
//! - **Cloud OAuth** ([`crate::oauth_routes`]) — the per-account discovery /
//!   DCR / authorize / token endpoints. PUBLIC (no [`CloudAuth`]): an MCP
//!   client bootstraps before any token exists, so each handler resolves the
//!   account from `Host` itself and is account-scoped through the control
//!   plane. The authorize-approve step verifies the session cookie. On the
//!   app host they resolve no subdomain and 404, like every tenant route.
//! - `/mcp` — atomic-server's MCP Streamable HTTP transport
//!   ([`mcp_scope`](atomic_server::app::mcp_scope)) under [`CloudAuth`] +
//!   [`cloud_plane_guard`]. The bearer MCP token the OAuth flow mints
//!   authenticates the request; CloudAuth injects the tenant's
//!   [`RequestDatabaseManager`], which the transport resolves per request
//!   (its cloud-unaware `RequestManager` override), so every tenant's `/mcp`
//!   call hits its own knowledge base — never the inert baked-in manager.
//!   CloudAuth *is* the MCP auth layer here (self-hosted's
//!   [`McpAuth`](atomic_server::mcp_auth) is not used), so it also produces
//!   the MCP-compliant 401: an unauthenticated `/mcp` request gets a
//!   `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…"` header pointing at the
//!   tenant's own `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (see
//!   [`crate::auth`] → `decorate_mcp_unauthorized`), so Claude Desktop
//!   discovers this account's OAuth flow. The same MCP token is governed by
//!   CloudAuth's `allowed_db_id` chokepoint as the data plane — a db-pinned
//!   token can't reach another KB through the transport's db selection.
//! - `/api/*` — atomic-server's full route table
//!   ([`api_scope`](atomic_server::app::api_scope)) wrapped in [`CloudAuth`]
//!   (in place of self-hosted's `BearerAuth`) plus [`cloud_plane_guard`].
//! - **The account-plane SPA** ([`crate::spa`]) — the built signup/login +
//!   `/account/*` dashboard, served when a [`SpaServer`](crate::spa::SpaServer)
//!   is wired, in two pieces both registered **after** every JSON route:
//!     - The **tenant dashboard gate**
//!       ([`AccountGate`](crate::spa::AccountGate)) — a tenant-host
//!       `GET /account/*` navigation, session-gated server-side: a valid
//!       session cookie serves the SPA shell, anything else `302`s to the
//!       app-host login. So an unauthenticated browser never renders the
//!       dashboard chrome (no flash-then-bounce), while an unauthenticated
//!       `/api/*` call still gets the structured JSON `401` (it's matched
//!       earlier, by CloudAuth) — the redirect is for HTML navigations only.
//!     - The **SPA fallback** (`default_service`) — registered **last**, so
//!       every explicit route above (including the gate) wins the match and
//!       the fallback only ever handles an unmatched path (an app-host
//!       client-routed page like `/login`, or a build asset on any host) — it
//!       can never shadow a JSON/API route.
//!   A deployment with no built frontend simply omits both and unmatched paths
//!   404.
//!
//! Deliberately **not** registered, with their replacements landing in later
//! slices (plan: `docs/plans/atomic-cloud.md`):
//!
//! - `configure_public_routes` — its instance setup, self-hosted `/ws`, API
//!   docs, and export download all assume the single-tenant identity model.
//!   (Cloud OAuth, formerly listed here, now ships as the per-account
//!   [`crate::oauth_routes`] plane above.)
//! - `/api/auth/*` (inside `api_scope`) is the self-hosted token plane; it
//!   operates on the composition-time [`AppState`] manager rather than the
//!   request's tenant. Cloud tokens live in the control plane
//!   ([`crate::tokens`]), so [`cloud_plane_guard`] unroutes the family
//!   entirely (404).
//! - The **export-job family** (inside `api_scope`:
//!   `POST /api/databases/{id}/exports/markdown`, `GET|DELETE
//!   /api/exports/{id}`) reads `state.export_jobs` — under cloud, the single
//!   inert fallback's `ExportJobManager`, one process-global namespace of
//!   job ids and artifacts shared by every tenant. Any authenticated tenant
//!   could fetch or delete another tenant's export by id, so
//!   [`cloud_plane_guard`] unroutes the family (404) until a per-tenant
//!   export story exists.
//! - **`GET /api/logs`** (inside `api_scope`) reads `state.log_buffer` —
//!   likewise a single process-wide ring buffer, not a per-tenant log
//!   stream. Unrouted (404) for the same reason.
//!
//! # The fallback `AppState` decision
//!
//! atomic-server's handlers and extractors require a `web::Data<AppState>`
//! in app data even when every request carries the
//! [`RequestDatabaseManager`] / [`RequestEventChannel`] extensions: the `Db`
//! extractor takes the state for its fallback unconditionally (see the
//! `FromRequest` doc in `atomic-server/src/db_extractor.rs`), and several
//! handlers extract `web::Data<AppState>` for `log_buffer` / `export_jobs`
//! (those handlers' routes are unrouted, per the list above).
//! The state's `manager` field cannot be absent, so the cloud composition
//! registers a **dedicated inert fallback** ([`FallbackAppState`]): an empty
//! SQLite scratch store in a process-lifetime temp directory. It is a
//! type-level placeholder, never a serving database:
//!
//! - [`CloudAuth`] installs the tenant extensions on every request it lets
//!   through, so the extractor fallback never fires.
//! - [`cloud_plane_guard`] makes that an invariant rather than a happy-path
//!   property: a request that somehow reaches the route table *without* the
//!   tenant extension is failed closed (500), not served from the fallback.
//! - The route families that bind composition-time state directly —
//!   `/api/auth/*` (manager), the export-job family (`export_jobs`),
//!   `/api/logs` (`log_buffer`), and the public/MCP planes — are unrouted
//!   or 404'd, per the list above.
//!
//! The alternative — teaching atomic-server to serve without an `AppState` —
//! would mean making the state's fields optional across ~78 routes for the
//! benefit of exactly one composition; the inert fallback plus a fail-closed
//! guard gets the same isolation guarantee without touching atomic-server.
